<th scope="col">I am an ecologist with a passion for data analysis. I received a Master's degree in Biology at New Mexico State University in 2024. My research focused on fungal community alterations under shifting vegetation regimes in the Chihuahuan Desert. I earned my BA in 2022 in Biology with minors in Education and Environmental Studies from Wheaton College MA. In my Master's and Undergraduate research, I utilized Next Generation Sequencing technologies and analyzed soil microbial communities using bioinformatics pipelines in Linux CL/Bash and statistical analyses in R and Excel.</th>
